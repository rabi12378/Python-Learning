# List comprehension is a short elegant way to create a list in one-line

data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
result = []
for each in data:
    result.append(each * 3)   # [3, 6, 9....18]

print(result)  # [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18]


result = [each*3 for each in data]    # list comprehension
print(result)  # [3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18]


# We can also use if condition in comprehension
result = [each*3 for each in data if (each*3) % 2 == 0]
print(result)  # Gives only the even results


# Create a list of even numbers in range 0 to 50 using comprehension
result = [each for each in range(0, 51) if each % 2 == 0]
print(result)


# Like list comprehension we also have dictionary comprehension in Python

result = {key: value for key, value in [("name", "Jon"), ("age", 30), ("address", "KTM")]}
print(result)  # {"name": "Jon", "age": 30, "address": "KTM"}


result = {i: i*2 for i in range(1, 10)}
print(result)   # {1: 2, 2: 4, 3: 6, ....9: 18}

# True and False are the boolean datatypes
# True and False itself are the keywords to represent True and False in Python

# Operations yielding boolean result
# Logical operations (and, or, not)
# Relational Operations (>, <, >=, <=, ==, !=)
# Membership Operation (in and not in)
# Identity Operation (is and is not)


# Boolean datatypes are the subclass of integer datatypes in python
# True is equals to 1
# False is equals to 0

a = True + True
print(a)  # 2
b = 50 * False
print(b)  # 0


# Concept of Truthy and Falsy in python Boolean

# Truthy
# All the non-empty datatypes along with True itself and non-zero number are the truthy data.
